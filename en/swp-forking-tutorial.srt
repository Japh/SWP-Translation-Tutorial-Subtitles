Submitting a Translation

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Steps are as follows:

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
1. Fork the Security White Paper repository

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,000
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,500
3. Make your changes

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
4. Commit changes and push them up to your forked repository

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
5. Make a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Open your browser and find the Security White Paper repository here:

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Click 'Fork' to create your own copy of this repository on GitHub

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
You may be asked to select where to fork the repository.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
So choose the appropriate location, probably your personal account

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
You can now see your repository, and where it's forked from.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Open your Git client. GitHub for Mac is being used for this tutorial.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Click to add a Git repository.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Select 'Clone'...

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Search for the correct repository...

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
And clone it!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Nominate where you would like it to be cloned on your computer.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Now you are ready to make changes!

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Add your translated version of the Security White Paper into the appropriate location

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
within the cloned repository on your computer.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Now in your Git client, commit your changes to your repository.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fill in a Summary...

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And, optionally, a description.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Click 'Commit'.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your commit is ready to be pushed up to GitHub.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Click 'Sync'

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Now you can click the 'Pull Request' icon to submit the changes made in

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
your repository back to the original repository.

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
You can adjust the Summary and Description for your pull request.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Click 'Send Pull Request'.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Success! You've now submitted your translation of the Security White Paper.

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Click the link to view it on GitHub.

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Now you wait for feedback on your request, or it may just be merged in.

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Good luck, and thanks for volunteering your time to help make WordPress

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
accessible in multiple languages!
